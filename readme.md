# Vue3 Firebase Composable Introduction w/ Ionic Framework

Firebase as come a long way and IMHO the API has gotten much easier to integrate into your applications event without third-party libraries.

This is the source code for the project I walkthru developing in the youtube video.

### Setting Firebase Configuration
- This project requires an `.env` file in the root directory of the project containing the project id for your firebase project
```
VUE_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=xxxx-yyyyy-dev
```
